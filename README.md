# tui-designer

quick tool for designing tui's (for [milj√∏](https://gitlab.com/cxss/miljo)) using nextjs, emotion, zustrand et al.

- font styling
  - bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- color palette
- special border characters
- select area & move

## todo

performance - constrained by the number of characters in the grid at any one point, purely due to how many components there are - e.g. a 200x64 grid will have 12,800 components in the terminal

tuis generally have a lot of empty space - so there's no point in rendering components that have no value/styling

a solution for this would be to absolutely position components in the grid & only insert components at a point where something (character,styling etc.) exists
